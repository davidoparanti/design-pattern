Design Principles

1) Identify the aspect of program that vary and separate them from what stay the same.
    This could also means: Isolating the path of the program that vary so that, later, that
    part could be alter or extended without affecting the part that don't.

2) Program to an interface not to implementation.

3) Favour composition over inheritance.

4) Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

5) Class should be open for extension but close for modification.

6) Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
